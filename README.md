# PasteAsSyslinkWin
Wouldn't it be great to copy some files and then paste then as syslink  
over the right click menu (context menu) like in linux, this makes it so

# Instalation
Download the newest exe script here:  
https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/PasteAsSyslinkWin/releases  
Start the file with dobble click,  
go throgh the promts,
now the extra context menu entry should appear.  
The classic context menu has to be enabled if your on windows 11.  
On windows 10 it will appear by default. 

If you want to download the code and compile yourself  
or run the script without compiling, you can also download it here:  
https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/PasteAsSyslinkWin/releases  
You will need Autohotkey if you want to compile the script for yourself  
or run the uncompiled .ahk script. 

# Info
Automated Instalation was now implemented, the language grammar was mostly fixed  
but a more complete and better documentation will follow soon.         
That has to do for now.
